# Ponder
## Sarah Hernandez - Summer 2022 - HCI 584
### A mood tracking web application developed for HCI 584 at Iowa State University.

All logos and images/gfx were also created by me- please do not use them for any other purpose besides playing with my code or showing it to someone else.

**HOW TO USE THIS CODE**

After cloning the repository...

1. Run the main program (app.py) via your terminal.

2. In your web browser, a window will pop up that says "Welcome to Ponder" and give you the option to either login or register.

3. Since you are a new user, click *Register*. You will be directed to this screen- enter all required information, then click *Register*.

4. Once you are registered, you will be redirected to the login page. Login to Ponder by entering your username and password. 

**If you enter the wrong password, the window will not redirect, but you will be given no notification because I didn't have time to add it. So if you have this issue, just try entering your information again after double checking it.**

5. Once you reach the above screen, you are logged in! Yay! Click on *Mood Entry* underneath the logo. You will be redirected to the mood entry screen.

6. Follow the instructions at the top of the page. You can make the text entry form larger by grabbing the corner. Each frog corresponds to the button to the left of it. When you have finished typing up your journal entry, choose your overall mood by clicking either *Happy*, *Sad*, *Angry*, *Meh*, *Romantic*, or *Stressed*. Your entry will then be finalized and you'll be redirected to a thank you page. 

**Unfortunately I could not figure out how to get the images I made to go OVER the button instead of beside it... if you can figure it out, let me know.**

7. For the sake of walking you through everything this app can do, choose *Previous Entries* before you log out. You will be redirected to a page that lists out any previous entries saved to your username. Ignore my desperation in some of the previous entries (lol).

8. Finally, you can click *Logout*, and you will be redirected to the Login Page again. Congrats, you just walked through my first web app!
